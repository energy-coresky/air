# The Coresky PHP Framework

Using the framework, you can create web applications of any type. It contains a lot of new original ideas:
"sky gate", "ghost query", "wares system" and more. By the way: the [Jet view parser][1]
has a release-candidate status and is architecturally more interesting than Blade or Twig.

Wellcome for contributors!
This project is my favorite "oil painting"! Not finished yet, but you can use it.

Regards,
Energy
