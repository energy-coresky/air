# The Coresky PHP Framework

Using the framework, you can create web applications of any type. It contains a lot of new original ideas:
sky-gate, ghost-query, wares-system and others.

Wellcome for contributors!
This project is my favorite "oil painting"! Not finished yet, but you can use it.

Regards,
Energy
